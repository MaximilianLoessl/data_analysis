# Project Brain-Area analysis

File preparation and basic analysis

## Reading
Launch the file [file_prep.R](file_prep.R) in the Terminal:

<code>Rscript --vanilla /path/to/Rscript/file_prep.R -y /path/to/health_controls -p /path/to/patients</code>

Get help with the -h flag:

<code>Rscript --vanilla /home/user/PD_analysis/file_prep.R -h</code>

```
Options:
        -y CHARACTER, --healthy=CHARACTER
                Give the path tho the healthy controls.
     Should be a dataframe containing all the subjects.  [example: /path/to/HC]

        -p CHARACTER, --patient=CHARACTER
                Give the path tho the patients.
     Should be a dataframe containing all the subjects.  [example: /path/to/PT]

        -o CHARACTER, --out=CHARACTER
                output file name [default "/mnt/c/Users/maxil/Documents/data_analysis/files"]

        -g CHARACTER, --group=CHARACTER
                add a grouping variable for both dataframes. In case you want to import multiple couples of HC/Pat.
    NOT POSSIBLE YET!!

        -f, --full
                Full analysis

        -k KEEP, --keep=KEEP
                Columnname you want to keep

        -j CHARACTER, --joke=CHARACTER
                build-in jokes

        -h, --help
                Show this help message and exit

```

The files of the <i>Health Controls HC</i> and the <i>Patients (PT)</i> should be in seperate folders. It is also possible to directly provide the path to the file. Furthermore, 2 files, containing for example the left and right hemisphere, can be used as input. They will be put together. If the input file consists only one hemisphere, it gets processed nevertheless

The file should come in the form of .txt or .csv. The first row should be the names of the Subjects, containing this somewhere in the string:

<code>sex_age</code>

For example:

<code>Patient_007_m_45_something</code>

This is important to get the age column if the age isn't already in the dataframe in the form of "age", "Age" or "AGE"

Based on the input as HC or PT, the <i>group column</i> gets computed and filled with either <i>hc</i> or <i>pt</i> 

The columns of dataframes get limited to one atlas and the names of the columns are shortened to the atlas names based on the respective match. The Atlas can be found and modified in the <b>[region.csv](region.csv)</b> file. 

The modified Dataframes will get stored in the <b>files</b> directory, which is the default output directory

---


## Analysis

The files for further analysis are taken from the files folder, where they were saved either by preprocessing using [file_prep.R](file_prep.R), or manually.

The dataframes should be saved as healthy_frame.csv and patient_frame.csv and look like this:

| Subject                     | lh_banksssts | lh_entorhinal |  ...  | age  |
| :---                        |    :----:    |      :---:    | :---: | ---: |
| Patient_007_m_45_something  | 4.28         | 3.78          |  ...  |  45  |
| Patient_008_f_33_else       | 2.25         | 3.12          |  ...  |  33  |

This is the format of the [file_prep.R](file_prep.R) standard-output. It may look different, when the [region](region.csv) gets changed

if the `-f` flag is added in the command line, the files [scn.R](scn.R) and [comparisons.R](comparisons.R) get launched. If the `-f` flag is not added, the dataframes only get read into the files folder.

## Problems

- Sometimes, you have to manually install the packages with <code>install.packages("packagename")</code>. This can cause the file to stop even before the help option. In that case do this:

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("optparse")
library(tidyverse)
library(optparse)
```
    After succesfully running these commands you should be able to get the help option.

## What is still missing?

1. The opportunity to read multiple separate subjects from a folder

2. A special analysis for the BIDS format
